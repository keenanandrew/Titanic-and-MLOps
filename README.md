# Titanic-and-MLOps
MLFlow, Optuna and GitHub Actions experiments

The objective is to be able to create and deliver ML models.

In addition, these models should be:

- Robust
- Production-grade
- CI/CD enabled
- Documented
- Kitted out with common libraries:
- - MLFlow for tracking model iterations
- - Optuna for hyperparameter tuning


## Roadmap

- Update GitHub Actions to track things in Jira
- Create branches for feature requests straight from Jira

### Updates:

- 4 Dec 2023: Added Jira integration
- And also CI/CD logging... well, we'll see.
